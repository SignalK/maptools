## Map Tools

 __Sample:__ http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SignalK/maptools/blob/master/src/test/resources/NZ61401/openlayers.html

 A collection of tools to aid in converting charts and maps for use in Signal K related projects
 
 In particular it has a BSB/KAP file processor that creates Openlayers compatible tile pyramids from NOAA USA nautical charts. 

 __WARNING__: The charts may or may not be accurately placed after processing! In the processsed folder is an openlayers.html file, 
 open it in a browser and compare the results with openstreetmap.org overlay. Dont trust these charts until you are satisfied 
 they are accurately processed and have you checked them against other known accurate sources. 
 
 See OpenSeaMaps.org for more charts. New Zealand, Bahamas, Brazil, Argentina, Germany and Netherlands seem to be available.

 The KAP functionality is based on the KAP parser from the Capcode project ( http://capcode.sourceforge.net ).
